### Seoul's Political Gridlock: A Nation Governed by Division

Minwoo Jung, Politics Desk | Seoul, South Korea

August 14, 2025 – To walk through Seoul today is to witness a society pulsing with innovation and cultural energy. Yet, beneath this dynamic surface lies a political reality defined by deep and unyielding gridlock. As of mid-2025, South Korean politics is characterized by a near-total stalemate between the conservative administration of President Yoon Suk Yeol and a National Assembly firmly controlled by the liberal opposition, the Democratic Party (DP). This standoff has led to legislative paralysis, stalled key reforms, and fueled a growing sense of frustration among a public weary of partisan warfare.

The core of the conflict is structural. With the presidency held by the People Power Party (PPP) and the legislature dominated by the DP, the basic functions of governance have become battlegrounds.1 President Yoon has frequently exercised his veto power to block opposition-led bills, while the Democratic Party has used its majority to stall presidential appointments and launch investigations into members of the administration. The result is a political "cold war" where progress on critical national issues is often held hostage to the political calendar.

The battlegrounds are numerous, but three stand out. First is the economy. The administration’s push for deregulation and corporate tax cuts to spur investment has been met with fierce resistance from the DP, which advocates for strengthening social safety nets and increasing spending to aid working-class families. Second are the dueling political investigations. Both parties have become consumed with probes targeting high-profile figures on the opposing side, a cycle critics lament as "politics of revenge" that distracts from substantive policymaking.

Perhaps most critical is the looming demographic crisis. With the world's lowest birth rate, South Korea faces an urgent need for comprehensive pension and labor reform to avoid a future economic catastrophe. Yet, these are precisely the kinds of difficult, long-term reforms that require broad political consensus—a consensus that is currently impossible to find. Experts warn that every month of inaction deepens the long-term challenge for the nation's youth.

This internal division has significant external consequences. As South Korea navigates its precarious position between an increasingly assertive China and its traditional ally, the United States, legislative gridlock can hamper the nation's ability to make swift, coherent foreign policy decisions. Likewise, a government consumed by infighting struggles to effectively address North Korea's consistent provocations.

For the average citizen, the sentiment is one of fatigue. Approval ratings for both parties remain low, and polls consistently show a public desire for compromise and a focus on livelihood issues. With the next major political test—the 2026 local elections—on the horizon, the partisan rhetoric is only expected to intensify. The critical question remains: can South Korea's leaders find a path through the division to chart a course for the future, or will the nation remain an argosy caught in the political doldrums?
