# Macron’s China Visit: Is Europe Seeking “Strategic Autonomy” from the U.S.?

*In April 2023, French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Beijing reignited debate over whether Europe should chart a more independent path in global affairs — and how far it can go without undermining its alliance with the United States.*

## Introduction

When French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in China on April 5, 2023, accompanied by a large delegation of business leaders and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, it was billed as a diplomatic outreach and economic opportunity. What emerged was something more provocative: a renewed push for “strategic autonomy” — the idea that Europe should be able to define and defend its own interests without relying too heavily on Washington.

In a year when Europe was more dependent on U.S. security guarantees than at any point since the Cold War, Macron’s remarks about avoiding becoming “vassals” in the U.S.–China rivalry struck a nerve on both sides of the Atlantic. The visit raised a deeper question: was this just French grandstanding, or a signal of an emerging European consensus?

## Strategic Autonomy: An Old Idea in a New Context

### Origins

The concept of European strategic autonomy predates Macron. It was floated in various forms after the Cold War, but gained traction after the 2003 Iraq War, when divisions over U.S. policy prompted calls for a more independent European foreign and defense posture.

In 2016, the **EU Global Strategy** formally embraced the term, framing it as the capacity for Europe to act “autonomously when and where necessary.”

---

### Macron’s Vision

Since taking office in 2017, Macron has championed strategic autonomy as central to Europe’s role in a multipolar world. In his view, Europe must be strong enough militarily, economically, and technologically to avoid being caught in the wake of U.S.–China competition.

Critics, however, accuse him of conflating autonomy with distancing from the U.S., particularly at moments when unity is needed most.

---

## Why China — and Why Now?

### Economic Stakes

China is the EU’s second-largest trading partner. French companies, from Airbus to luxury brands like LVMH, see China’s consumer market as critical for growth. Macron’s trip included business deals and market-access discussions, underscoring the economic incentives for engagement.

---

### Diplomatic Timing

The visit came just as tensions between Washington and Beijing were intensifying over Taiwan, technology restrictions, and the aftermath of the spy balloon incident. For Macron to call for Europe not to be “followers” in a U.S.–China conflict over Taiwan was a deliberate choice — and one guaranteed to grab headlines.

---

### Ukraine’s Shadow

The war in Ukraine shaped the subtext of the trip. While Europe has remained firmly aligned with the U.S. in supporting Kyiv, Macron’s message implied that such unity should not automatically translate into unquestioned alignment with Washington on every issue, especially China.

---

## Reactions at Home and Abroad

### In Europe

Reactions were mixed. Some leaders, particularly in Eastern Europe, viewed Macron’s comments as ill-timed and undermining transatlantic unity. Others saw them as a realistic acknowledgment that Europe’s interests are not always identical to Washington’s.

Von der Leyen’s presence, and her more cautious rhetoric, highlighted an EU divide: a desire for economic engagement with China, tempered by growing concerns over human rights and security dependencies.

---

### In the United States

Macron’s remarks triggered criticism from U.S. lawmakers and commentators who saw them as a gift to Beijing. To some in Washington, the idea of strategic autonomy sounded like strategic drift at a time when the West needed to close ranks.

---

### In Beijing

China welcomed Macron warmly, framing his visit as evidence that Europe is not monolithic and can resist “bloc confrontation.” State media emphasized his comments on Taiwan as proof of a potential wedge between the U.S. and Europe.

---

## The Real Limits of Autonomy

### Security Realities

The war in Ukraine underscored Europe’s reliance on U.S. military power — from intelligence and logistics to advanced weapon systems. NATO remains the backbone of European defense, and no EU framework currently matches its capabilities.

---

### Economic Interdependence

While Europe wants to avoid excessive dependence on any one partner, disentangling from the U.S. economically — especially in finance, technology, and defense industries — would be costly and politically difficult.

---

### Internal Divisions

EU members have different threat perceptions and strategic priorities. Eastern states focus on deterring Russia; southern members on Mediterranean stability; others on economic competitiveness. Achieving a coherent “autonomous” strategy that satisfies all is a tall order.

---

## Conclusion

Macron’s China visit was less about Beijing than about Europe’s identity in a shifting global order. It reflected France’s long-standing belief in a Europe that can act as a power in its own right, not merely as a junior partner to the U.S.

But autonomy is not the same as isolation. For now, Europe’s security still leans heavily on the transatlantic alliance — and its ability to project influence abroad depends, paradoxically, on the very relationship Macron seeks to balance.

The real test will be whether Europe can turn strategic autonomy from a speech into a strategy — and whether it can do so without sacrificing the unity that has been its greatest strength since February 2022.
